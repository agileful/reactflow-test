### Project Explanation

## Dependencies
The project  uses React for building the user interface, ReactFlow for creating the interactive flow diagram, and Material-UI (MUI) for styling components.
## Visualization: 
The main purpose of this project is to visualize the orbits of asteroids around the Earth. It fetches data about near-Earth objects (asteroids) from NASA's API and displays them in a circular pattern around the Earth.
## Interactive Controls
Users can interact with the visualization through controls like zooming, panning, and dragging. They can also select individual asteroids to change that asteroid style.
## Node Styling
The project allows users to customize the styling of individual asteroid nodes. Users can change the background color and text color of selected nodes.
## Modular Design
The code is organized into reusable components, which promotes maintainability and scalability.

Overall, this project serves as an example of how to create an interactive visualization using React and ReactFlow, while also demonstrating good coding practices such as modularity and error handling
